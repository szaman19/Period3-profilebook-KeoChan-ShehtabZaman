========================================

A java based social networking media structure of linked profiles with customizable information 

Our goal was to be able to read and write to text files so that profiles could be shared between people by simply adding one's Profile text file to a repo.  We got the writing part down but not the reading part.  Otherwise, the profiles should be fully functioning as profiles, in that they can store the necessary information and interact with each other.  The other feature was that friends lists can be sorted by common interests or number of mutual friends, so that when new Profiles were added to the collection, they would be more useful to the user.  Status has a timestamp and a message and should work as well.  We never finished the interface, although we wrote methods and used scanner for creating a Profile through the terminal (and writing a text file from it).  At that point we promptly ran out of time/fell asleep because it was 2am.  Enjoy!
